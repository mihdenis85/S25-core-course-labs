# Python Web Application

## Web framework choice

I decided to use `Flask` framework because it is simple and wide-used python web framework.
It has all necessary functionality that can be used in web development.

## Applied best practices

- I decided to follow KISS principle which is the most suitable for simplest applications.
- I configured `pre-commit` hooks (in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file).
- I used `black` formatter for formatting the code, `pylint` for linting, 
and the code was statically checked by `mypy`.
- I used `markdownlint` to check documentation style.

## Testing

I tested this application manually and compared outputs with
